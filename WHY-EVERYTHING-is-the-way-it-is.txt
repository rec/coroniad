Earth man

Why are we the way we are?  What went wrong?  And how can we fix it?

I have some ideas on these matters which I need to explain in this limited series on Medium.

I will keep it as terse as possible.  I love to write but your time is valuable.

This twenty-part series will go as far as logic, mathematics, science and
verifiable facts can take us on the big picture of how we got to this point,
and how human civilization could survive the coming century.

I want to present a correct argument, so corrections, clarifications and
amplifications will be gladly accepted, though I might ignore quibbles.


* E-prime: necessary and unnecessary simplifications.

Too much information exists.

We simplify the world into concepts, symbols,
words, facts, rules, stereotypes and caricatures because it would otherwise
overwhlem us.  These simplifications unavoidably lead to mistakes, but we
persevere.

Humans have developed mental tools to reduce mistakes.

Logic and formal reasoning automatically prevent some common classes of
mistakes, if carefully applied.

Numbers and mathematics give an objective and unchanging conceptual
("Platonic") view of the world: having correct numbers doesn't make your
argument right, but having incorrect numbers definitely makes your argument
wrong.

I would like to keep my mistake rate as low as possible, so I'm going to keep it
brief, but I'd like to keep my logical error rate down too, so I write these
articles in a dialect of English called E-prime.

A Polish mathematician named Korzybsky pointed out that many logical errors in
European languages, particularly English, stem from the fact that the verb "to
be" has a very imprecise meaning.

What does a statement like "Knowledge is power" mean?  It does not equate
"knowledge" and "power" because these are two different concepts, but says
something amorphous like, "Some Knowledge can be used to achieve some of what
you wish".

Or consider, "Mike is a crook."  But at this moment, Mike sleeps. What crookness
"is" there about him right now?  Can I measure it somehow?  I once stole a juice
from a store when I was a kid.  "Am" I a crook?  "Was" I a crook then and if so,
for how long?

The verb "to be" simplifies the world to the point of gross inaccuracy.

Avoiding "to be" or its conjugations like "was" forces more precision and
accurate speech: "I suspect that Mike did some dishonest things", or "I believe
that Mike committed crimes," or "Public evidence exists showing that Mike has
committed crimes," or "I believe Mike plans to rob from his busines," or "at
about the age of ten, I stole a drink from a shop".

So I write these articles in E-prime.  Please correct any errors which will
undoubtedly creep in.


Part one: how humans are put together.



* The ego: individualism, the selection effect and the anthropic principle

* Time, space and scale: hyperbolic discounting and hyperobjects

* Game theory, the prisoner's dilemma and cheats, Kant's categorical imperative

* Mathematics, magic and the contradiction

* Gods, personalization and mirror neurons - how to summon the Holy Guardian Angel

* Summary


Part two: what has gone wrong?
------------------------------------

* The Terracide is the greatest crime in history

* Industrial capitalism is constantly revolting and consumerism is its profhit.
  Free markets are not free because they are built on a tissue of lies

* Idiomania and the fountain of filth

* A nest of ASPs - how the psychos stole everyone's tomorrow

* Now... this: the theft of depth and meaning Premonition of the apocalypse

* Summary


Part three: how could it be fixed?
-------------------------------------

* My favorite Martian: looking back from 2332

* Population overshoot and the transition
 * brace yourselves, this part won't be pretty

* We take over

* Who are We and how do We make decisions?
