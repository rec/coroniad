👑 The Coroniad: tiny useful elegant programmer tools 👑
----------------------------------------------------------------

The virus knocked all my conceipts and conceptions into a cocked hat, so I had a lot of spare time
on my hands.

I love building tools, and I always have a lot of little tools just lying around 
(https://github.com/rec?tab=repositories), so I decided to extract the most useful and interesting parts
and polish them until they were Practically Perfect™, then unleash them upon an unsuspecting public with 
a new article once a week, and continue until we are all clear, or until I run out of tools to polish.
